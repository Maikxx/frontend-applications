# Risk Indication App

## Progress

### Week 1

In the first week I attended four days of full-day-study colleges.

I went to the guest speakers talks, this tuesday, where my boss (Peter Peerdeman from Lifely) was talking about React.

When I had to choose three frameworks, which I would like to learn, I chose:
* Vue
* React
* Polymer.

The next day, me and three others had decided for us that we needed to do Polymer.
This was a big bummer, because I would have liked to learn Vue more.

What also was not great, was the fact that Polymer has terrible docs and barely any community support.
We got the framework to work in about a day, which was not terrible, but understanding still has to be gained.

When I finally got the support talk with Laurens, I knew what the excersise was about.
I decided to make a risk indication application for the healtcare workers, so that they get an easier job.
